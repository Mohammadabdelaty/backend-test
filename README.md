# backend-test
Welcome to NodeJs note
This repo is for understanding API, backend with mostly used node js, and it's for getting comfortable with deplying projects in kuberentes or dokcer, and sepcefically troubleshooting issues after something like helm installations and things crash suddenly.

# npm
start your nodejs project with 
```bash
npm init -y
## -y is for accepting some default values about the fiirst project data
```
It creates package.json (check it out)

# Build Server
Let's start building the server with Express framwork
```bash
npm install express
```
It creates `package-lock.json`, modules version will be stored in here, and `node-modules` dir with the modules.

# Create your app
